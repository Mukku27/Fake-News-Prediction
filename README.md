# Fake News Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a Fake News Detection project. The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether a given news article is fake or real based on the provided dataset (`train.csv`).

## Introduction

Fake news detection is a challenging problem, especially with the vast amount of information available online. This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify news articles as "Real" or "Fake" using a Logistic Regression model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project (`train.csv`) consists of news articles with the following columns:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each news article.
- `title`: The title of the news article.
- `author`: The author of the news article.
- `text`: The main content of the news article.
- `label`: The label for each article, where `1` indicates "Fake" news and `0` indicates "Real" news.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you'll need Python 3.x installed along with the necessary packages. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source# Fake-News-Prediction
Here's the updated `README.md` file without the License and Contact sections:

```markdown venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:

   Open the `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb` notebook and run the cells step-by-step to train the model and make predictions.

## Model Details

- **Text Preprocessing**: The text data is preprocessed using techniques such as lowercasing, removal of special characters, stopword removal, and stemming using NLTK's PorterStemmer.
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization is used to convert text data into numerical features.
- **Model**: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the processed text data to classify news articles as fake or real.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics on both training and test datasets. The notebook contains detailed code for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
